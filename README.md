<h1>Functions</h1>
<h2>f(double[] poly, double x)</h2>
Takes a polynomial function, x.
Returns the y value for said polynumial.
<br><br>


<h2>root_rec(double[] p, double x1, double x2, double eps)</h2>
Takes a polynomial function, range [x1, x2] and epsilon.
Returns the x position within range that it's y = 0 ± epsilon.
<br><br>


<h2>polynomFromPoints(double[] xx, double[] yy)</h2>
Takes 2-3 points.
Returns a polynomial function that passes through those points.
<br><br>


<h2>equals(double[] p1, double[] p2)</h2>
Takes 2 polynomials.
Returns if the 2 polynomials are equal.
<br><br>


<h2>poly(double[] poly)</h2>
Takes a polynomial.
Returns the standard mathmatical representation of said polynomial.
<br><br>


<h2>sameValue(double[] p1, double[] p2, double x1, double x2, double eps)</h2>
Takes 2 polynomials, range [x1, x2] and epsilon.
Returns the x position within range that it's y is the intersection of said polynomials ± epsilon.
<br><br>

        
<h2>length(double[] p, double x1, double x2, int numberOfSegments)</h2>
Takes a polynomial, range [x1, x2] and the number of segments. 
Returns the length of said polynomial within range, in accordence to the number of samples (higher sample count = higher resulution).
<br><br>


<h2>area(double[] p1, double[] p2, double x1, double x2, int numberOfTrapezoid)</h2>
Takes 2 polynomials, range [x1, x2] and the number of samples.
Returns the area between the polynomials within range, in accordence to the number of samples (higher sample count = higher resulution).
<br><br>


<h2>expressionOrganizer(String p)</h2>
Takes a polynomial in it's mathmatical form.
It (currently doesn't expand them fully) removes any uneccery whitespaces.
Returns a String array containing every element of given polynomial.
<br><br>


<h2>getPolynomFromString(String p)</h2>
Takes a polynomial in it's mathmatical form.
Returns a polynomial as an array.
